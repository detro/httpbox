`httpbox` is a Command line HTTP client that aims to be as feature rich as your shell scripting skills can handle.

**WARNING:** This is me, finally finding the time to learn a bit of Rust and _Rust-best-practices_.
If I'm doing anything wrong, please make sure you yell at me... gently. :)

## How to build

### Binary executable from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/httpbox)

2. `cargo install httpbox`

### From [GitHub](https://github.com/detro/httpbox) source repository

There is nothing special in how to compile `httpbox` compared to any other Rust binary:

1. Install [rustup](https://www.rustup.rs/)
2. `git clone git@github.com:detro/httpbox.git`
3. `cd httpbox`
4. `cargo build` or `cargo build --release` (for the release artifact, duh!)
